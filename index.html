  Greetings newcomer (or returning visitor) and welcome to my website! My name is Andrew Hou and I'm a 3rd year computer vision PhD student at Michigan State University specializing in face modeling problems, especially face relighting, face reconstruction, and shadow synthesis/removal. I am fortunately advised by Dr. Xiaoming Liu and am a member of the Computer Vision Lab. Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science from Brown University in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
  In summer 2021, I was a research intern at Bosch in Sunnyvale, California, where I was fortunate to work with Drs. Xinyu Huang, Liu Ren, and Sharath Gopal on foreign shadow removal from face portraits. I will be returning to Bosch for another great summer this year!

  <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
  As one might expect from a computer vision researcher, I am generally very interested in visual content of all kinds including movies, anime, art, you name it. I'm also avid about board games, card games, fighting games, ...... you get the idea. Outside of my overwhelmingly geeky side, I also enjoy a wide range of sports including (but definitely not limited to) tennis, badminton, swimming, running, ice skating, and cross country skiing. Similar to most individuals, I also enjoy food!
